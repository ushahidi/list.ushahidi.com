Hello all,<div><br></div><div>First post here, not really an Ushahidi developer yet, for the moment the NGO I work with has a couple projects that use it and since we love it, we&#39;re starting customization to meet our needs (which differ a bit from the typical Crwodmap sites - it&#39;s a biking support site).</div>

An option might be to ensure that database interaction is abstracted<br>
enough that it doesn&#39;t matter what the underlying database is... and<br>
this is something that might be worth looking into.<br></blockquote><div><br></div><div>I&#39;d love to see some DB abstraction on Ushahidi. If possible, have a &quot;quick and dirty&quot; approach using mysql that allows a quick deployment, but as a site scales up and requires further optimizations, allow better back-ends for efficiency.</div>
