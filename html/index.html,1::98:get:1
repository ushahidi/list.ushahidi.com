<div dir="ltr"><div><div><div><div><div><div>hi everyone - i&#39;m looking for Ushahidi maps that were used in running a campaign around a proposed project with environmental harm.<br></div>i&#39;m trying to get a NGO here in toronto to use the deployment i started - Great Lakes Commons Map - for their campaign about a oil pipeline (Line 9 - tar sands oil - which is actually also being worked on by a host of other citizen groups).<br>
<br></div>i&#39;m trying to make the case for this NGO to use my deployment (since it has many water threats) so that they can get more people engaged in the campaign and spread the work around (typical NGO burnout seems to be the norm). <br>
<br></div>as part of my pitch i&#39;m looking for related deployments that used place-based, collaborative, rich media tools to do public education, engagement, and a campaign against a proposed threat. <br><br></div>suggestions, links, and comments welcomed. <br>
<br></div>thanks,<br>paul<br></div><a href="http://www.greatlakescommonsmap.org">http://www.greatlakescommonsmap.org</a><br></div>
