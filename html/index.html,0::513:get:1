  <span>Hey Folks!<br>
<br>
Hope you're all doing great! <br>
<br>
We recently launched a campaign dubbed &#8220;Translators Power Ushahidi&#8221;, in a
 bid to push for the translation of 15 new languages to more than 80% 
complete by the end of the year, and we need your help!<br>
<br>
Here's a short guide, for anyone who needs help getting started with 
translations on Ushahidi.<br>
<br>
<a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="https://wiki.ushahidi.com/display/WIKI/Localization+and+Translation+-+How+to">https://wiki.ushahidi.com/display/WIKI/Localization+and+Translation+-+How+to</a><br>
<br>
We are cooking up some special Ushahidi Translator gear for you : 
t-shirts, stickers for your laptops, as a way to say thank you to all of
 you who help us reach this goal. For translators who lead the pack in 
100% complete translations in their respective languages by Dec. 31st, 
2014, we have a very special, limited edition vintage tee, commemorating
 your efforts for posterity.<br>
<br>
A warm thank you to Eskender Beza, Ngamnet Aektasaeng and team who 
recently brought Thai translations on the Ushahidi Platform up from less
 than 10% to nearly 100% in just about a month, and Juergen Eichholz, <a
 href="https://twitter.com/jke/status/504405190175256577">who just 
managed to get German translation to 100% for all ushahidi products </a>in
 the last few days!<br>
<br>
Translators power Ushahidi, you make our world go round and we salute 
you. In case you have any questions, or concerns, don&#8217;t hesitate to send
 us a note &#8211; we would love to hear from you!<br>
<br>
&#12354;&#12426;&#12364;&#12392;&#12358;, Grazzi, Asante, Obrigado, Thank You! <br>
