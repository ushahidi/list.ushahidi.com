Hi Guys,<br>The theming functionality in 2.0b10 has changed and I 
apologize for not sending this email as soon as the code went up - 
especially if your themes are not showing up anymore. We&#39;re now giving 
themes access to php files too so that you can modify the structure of 
the public facing website.<br>
<br>This is how the themes directory looks like now:<br><br>- <u><b>themes</b></u><br>    - <b>default</b><br>        + css<br>        + images<br>        + views<br>        <i>readme.txt</i><br>    + terra<br><br>The
 default theme should not be deleted as every other theme in reality 
extends the default. This means that you can create a new theme that 
contains only a css file or a header ... I&#39;m sure you get the idea.<br>
<br>Also, in order for your theme to appear in the <i><b>admins/addons</b></i> section, you&#39;ll need to have a <i><b>readme.txt</b></i>. The readme.txt should contain the following information... each tag is self explanatory.<br>


<br><div style="margin-left: 40px;"><b>Theme Name:</b> My Theme<br><b>Description:</b> This is a great theme for my map<br><b>Demo:</b> <a href="http://facebook.com/ushahidi/" target="_blank">http://facebook.com/ushahidi/</a><br>

<b>Version:</b> 3.0<br>
<b>Author:</b> Mark Zuckerberg<br><b>Author Email:</b> <a href="mailto:thezuck@..." target="_blank">thezuck@...</a><br></div><br>You can look to <a href="http://github.com/ushahidi/Ushahidi_Web/blob/2.0/themes/terra/readme.txt" target="_blank">http://github.com/ushahidi/Ushahidi_Web/blob/2.0/themes/terra/readme.txt</a> for an example of how to set it up.<br>


<br>Regards,<br><br>David.<br>
