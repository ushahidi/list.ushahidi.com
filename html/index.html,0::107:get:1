Hello list,<br><br>I added Ushahidi-web as a project on ohloh. Ohloh tracks developers and source code automatically, so no action is required, but I think the listing at ohloh might attract new attention to ushahidi.<br><br>
The project is here: <a href="https://www.ohloh.net/p/ushahidi-web/">https://www.ohloh.net/p/ushahidi-web/</a><br><br>If you have an ohloh account, you can link yourself to your commits.<br>If anyone else wants to manage the project on ohloh, please let me know. I would gladly give ownership to the right owners.<br>
