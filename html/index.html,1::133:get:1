Hi everyone, if you have a <a href="http://Forums.ushahidi.com">Forums.ushahidi.com</a> account, you will have also received a note from me about changes to the Forums.<br><br>Summary - Forums are now part of the wiki<br><br>

<a href="https://wiki.ushahidi.com/display/forums/Ushahidi+Forums">https://wiki.ushahidi.com/display/forums/Ushahidi+Forums</a><br clear="all"><br><br>Our goal is to get all the community touchpoints into the wiki in the next few months. Thus, you&#39;ll have one login for everything. Also note that all the forum responses were up to date on the legacy forums. <br>
