<br><br>Hello LibTech,<br>
<br>
We are excited to share that the Open Technology Fund (OTF) at Radio<br>
Free Asia (RFA)’s ongoing solicitation of concept notes is open and<br>
receiving proposals. We seek to fund disruptive technology projects that<br>
advance global Internet freedom and human rights online. If you are<br>
interested in submitting a concept note for our consideration, the<br>
process begins by completing our short online form:<br>
<a href="https://opentechfund.org/submit" target="_blank">https://opentechfund.org/submit</a>. More information about our full<br>
proposal process can be found on our website:<br>
<a href="https://opentechfund.org/submit/guide" target="_blank">https://opentechfund.org/submit/guide</a>.<br>
<br>
OTF utilizes public funds to support Internet freedom projects. We<br>
support projects that develop open and accessible technologies promoting<br>
human rights and open societies. We strive to advance inclusive and safe<br>
access to global communication networks.<br>
<br>
Created in 2012, OTF is an RFA program supported by funds from the<br>
Broadcasting Board of Governors (BBG). The BBG’s mission is to inform,<br>
engage, and connect people around the world in support of freedom and<br>
democracy. RFA’s mission is to provide accurate and timely information<br>
to the people of Asia who lack adequate protections for freedom of<br>
expression, free speech, and a free press.<br>
<br>
In a globally interconnected society, creating and protecting freedom of<br>
expression, free speech, and a free press requires cross-border<br>
technology tools that enable the exercise of human rights within<br>
repressive societies for the global population. OTF strives to incubate<br>
and support projects creating these tools around the world. More<br>
information on our program can be found at <a href="https://opentechfund.org/about" target="_blank">https://opentechfund.org/about</a>.<br>
<br>
If you have any questions, please send them our way by emailing <a href="mailto:otf@...">otf@...</a>.<br>
<br>
We look forward to your submission.<br>
