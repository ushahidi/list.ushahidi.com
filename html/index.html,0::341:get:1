Hey,<div><br></div><div>I want to incorporate a payment(donation) module in my Ushahidi instance..I have been scouring the Ushahidi forum and net looking for an example of how it has been/can be implemented but I am yet to find a proper way explaining how to go about it.If anybody on the list has been able to tackle this and can spare some time please share the knowledge :-).. I will be extremely grateful.</div>
