      What do you want your plugin to do. <br>
      <br>
      Also the documentation looks correct to me. Can you be more
      specific about the trouble your having? Are you having run time
      errors, or are things just not functioning like you want?<br>
      <br>
      Thanks,<br>

        Hi folks,<br>
        <br>
        I'm based in Canada and I'm trying to write Ushahidi plugins. I
        specifically need info about what class and library files are
        needed to make a plugin work, and <br>
        also some examples on how to create a plugin.<br>
        <br>
        I've searched online extensively for info on writing Ushahidi
        plugins/Kohana plugins but haven't found any adequate info<br>
        on how to do this. I also followed the documentation at<br>
        <a href="https://wiki.ushahidi.com/display/WIKI/How+To+Write+A+Plugin" target="_blank">https://wiki.ushahidi.com/<wbr>display/WIKI/How+To+Write+A+<wbr>Plugin</a>
        to write a plugin but it doesn't work. This documentation page
        also needs<br>
        updating or revising because the instructions don't work.&nbsp; <br>
        <br>
        I've also asked Ushahidi developers but haven't heard back from
        them.&nbsp; Can anyone help me? Thanks.<br>
        <br>
        <br>
