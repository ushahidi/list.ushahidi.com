<div dir="ltr"><div><div><div><div><div><div>Hi people,<br><br>I&#39;m Brazilian and new at Ushahidi!<br><br></div>I&#39;m trying to make a modification in Ushahidi so that i can list a bunch of cities and, when i click a link, it changes the focus of the map to a given city.<br>

<br></div>I&#39;ve started last week to study the codes from Ushahidi and i&#39;m a little bit lost. Im a programmer but have never worked with web languages!<br><br></div>Im not sure how should i proceed, im trying to do this just changing the theme and some javascript because i&#39;m in a kind of a hurry, but i want to develop a plugin to do this.<br>

<br></div>Do you have any idea how should i proceed? Any suggestions?<br><br></div>Thank you very much and congratulations for the project, its just incredible!<br><br></div>See you,<br>Gabriel Fonseca.<br></div>
