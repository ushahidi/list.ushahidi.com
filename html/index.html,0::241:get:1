Hi John,<div>Alerting admins when new messages and reports have come in have been a recurrent ask and so whichever way it best fits then I say go for it. At first I thought it would make sense as a plugin but if the notifications bit is easier to build on then we can go with it.<br>

    So I&#39;ve had a client ask me why after checking &quot;Receive
    Notifications&quot; that their users never get any notifications.<br>
    <br>
    I looked at the code, and it seems like this drop down box does
    nothing, nothing at all. I think it&#39;s a worthwhile feature to
    have... I guess I should state that I assume &quot;Receive Notifications&quot;
    means that the user would get an email saying things like, &quot;New
    report: &#39;XYZ&#39; Submited via Web by &#39;<a href="mailto:frank123@..." target="_blank">frank123@...</a>.&quot; Is that what
    everyone else thinks? Though it does seem that &quot;Actions&quot; can
    accomplish the same thing, though with just a generic email.<br>
    <br>
    Is the current thinking of the Ushahidi team to go with Actions and
    do away with Receive Notifications? Or would it bother anyone if a
    implemented the functionality I just described?<br>
    <br>
    My clients basically want an alert for Admins that lets them know
    when new messages and reports have come in so they can verify them.
    Or would it be best to do all this with a plugin?<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    Thanks,<br>
    <br>
