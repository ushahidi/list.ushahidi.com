Chris - I suspect the problem might be with utf-8 email addresses like <b>blähblü<a href="mailto:h@...">h@...</a></b> -- is there any way to find out whether the problem is the email addresses or the actual content of the emails?<br>

Hello.<br>
<br>
Anybody know why utf8 emails are not going out? How is the encoding set on outbound emails, could that be postfix overriding the headers or something?<br>
