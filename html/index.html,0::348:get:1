Curious if you have a vague idea (non-binding, of course) of when 3.0<br>
Alpha / Beta might be expected? Something within a range of months (or<br>
years even) would be helpful.<br>
<br>
And thanks for the awesome work,<br>

&gt; Hi All,<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Just a quick update on Ushahidi 3.0. Now that Uchaguzi is done I&#39;m getting<br>
&gt; moving building API, and we&#39;re starting to dig into the design and workflow<br>
&gt; issues. You can see what&#39;s happening on the wiki<br>
&gt; <a href="https://wiki.ushahidi.com/display/WIKI/REST+API" target="_blank">https://wiki.ushahidi.com/display/WIKI/REST+API</a> and in the Github repo<br>
&gt; <a href="https://github.com/ushahidi/Lamu" target="_blank">https://github.com/ushahidi/Lamu</a>.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Tracking the build<br>
&gt; We&#39;re trying to keep the processes lightweight, however there&#39;s still a lot<br>
&gt; to build. I&#39;m tracking a backlog of features and other issues through github<br>
&gt; issues: <a href="https://github.com/ushahidi/Lamu/issues" target="_blank">https://github.com/ushahidi/Lamu/issues</a><br>
&gt; As each feature gets started we&#39;ll be adding rough spec details and comments<br>
&gt; to the ticket description, and when features are complete they&#39;ll be code<br>
&gt; reviewed using Github pull requests. Each of these steps is a chance for you<br>
&gt; to comment on how we&#39;re doing and suggest improvements.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Most tasks will get assigned to and built by the internal team. But if you<br>
&gt; want to get involved in v3 development chime in on a ticket and let us know<br>
&gt; where you can help.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; A lot of discussion is happening between the core team at the moment, but as<br>
&gt; we get further in we&#39;ll be trying to open that up and get community feedback<br>
&gt; as well.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Early targets and migration<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; As we&#39;re pushing forward with v3, one the big items is going to be migration<br>
&gt; from Ushahidi 2.x.<br>
&gt; To ensure this works smoothly we&#39;ve set a couple of early targets:<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; 3.0 Alpha will try to cover core 2.x features and include an import script<br>
&gt; to pull data from 2.x. This will really be for developers and hard-core<br>
&gt; testers only. At this stage we won&#39;t be aiming for a nice import UI, just a<br>
&gt; solid import so we can start testing and ensure we don&#39;t lose data.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; 3.0 Beta will go further on migration. Migrating from 2.x will mostly likely<br>
&gt; be integrated into the UI of the installer. It may not be polished at this<br>
&gt; stage, but it should be enough have early adopters trying out the process<br>
&gt; and getting running.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Shout out if you have any more question on the 3.0 build. I&#39;ll try and send<br>
&gt; more updates every few weeks as we get moving.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Keep on mapping!<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Robbie<br>

&gt; PS I should have to Posts API ready for code review soon for anyone<br>
&gt; interested.<br>
