<div dir="ltr">Hey team,<div><br></div><div>Just a heads up that I&#39;ve been trying to go through the tickets on GitHub and I&#39;m having trouble finding stuff that I can do. Most of the things on the Bug and P1 list have been are very old, fixed, outdated or missing information, and I understand we won&#39;t be working on features for 2.x anymore.</div>

<div><br></div><div>Have to say it&#39;s pretty frustrating not having a direction on what to do as a volunteer. I wanna help and I understand that GitHub is the main source of things to work on, but I have the feeling there hasn&#39;t been a lot of movement there from the core team on the 2.x project. It is a bit hard for the community to take action without direction and support. :(</div>

<div><br></div><div>Sorry for the slightly bitchy email again. I understand you guys are fairly busy with other stuff, and I have been annoying Robbie to the extend I feel comfortable with already (thanks by the way, bru!). Just thought I should put it out there so we can try and keep things awesome.</div>

<div><br></div><div><br></div><div>Hugs,</div><div><br clear="all"><div>Diogo Freire<div>+64 21 140 1055</div></div>
