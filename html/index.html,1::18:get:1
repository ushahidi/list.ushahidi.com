Hi everyone, happy Wednesday!<br><br>There are a few deployers in the news this week.  I&#39;ve posted about that in the weekly(link below). Special mention to Women Under Siege for their ongoing efforts to document and amplify ongoing issues in Syria. Our team has worked fairly closely with the deployers.<br>

<br>Henry, Robbie and I are reworking the translation tools. A few community members are testing the translation workflow. If you are a translator, we&#39;d love a hand. Just drop me a line.<br><br>The wiki is continuing to grow in content. What do you think we should focus on next to make it better for the community? Would you be willing to edit a section? <br>

<br><br>Here the full weekly report - <a href="https://wiki.ushahidi.com/display/WIKI/Weekly+14+-+July+10+-+17%2C+2012">https://wiki.ushahidi.com/display/WIKI/Weekly+14+-+July+10+-+17%2C+2012</a><br><br>Have a good rest of your week,<br>
