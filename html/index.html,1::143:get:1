HI friends, <br><br>I think maps are connectors for communities. This is why I love <a href="https://wiki.ushahidi.com/display/WIKI/Data+Cleanup+Project+-+Community+Task">Food Sync</a> - our Deployment of the Week. I think we should have that in every city.<br>

<br>We&#39;ve got some great discussions coming up:<br><br>Mapping Syria will feature 3 projects that are documenting and monitoring human rights violations. The iHub Research team has released their Uchaguzi Election Monitoring report. Join us for a discussion about best practices in elections. Plus, if you are in Portland, come visit!  <br>

<br>Data Helpers - I&#39;ve written up some draft Data cleanup Guidelines. <a href="https://wiki.ushahidi.com/display/WIKI/Data+Cleanup+Project+-+Community+Task">Have I covered everything? Edit away.</a><br><br>More in the Weekly: <br>
