Happy Week!<br><br><br>New Crowdmap has been growing. We&#39;ve got users from around the work, plus better docs. <a href="https://wiki.ushahidi.com/display/WIKI/Crowdmap">https://wiki.ushahidi.com/display/WIKI/Crowdmap</a>   One thing we&#39;ve started is Topic of the Week. This week we are testing out posting jokes from email as #TOW, but much like Ushahidi there are all types of posts from Turkey to maps to gardens. We have a Crowdmap Community Forum on Monday June 18th 9am EDT. It will be recorded, but please do join us for a demo, questions and to meet other community folks. <a href="https://plus.google.com/u/1/events/c4r5105vc3gmbdi3otjmgcfh04c">https://plus.google.com/u/1/events/c4r5105vc3gmbdi3otjmgcfh04c</a><br>
