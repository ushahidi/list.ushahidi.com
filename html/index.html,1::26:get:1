Happy Friday, <br><br><br>
We&#39;ve moved to Transifex for Translations.This will make it easier for 
you to get your deployment into your language. We&#39;ve got some language 
team leads starting to form. <a href="https://wiki.ushahidi.com/display/WIKI/Localization+and+Translation">Check our our wiki pages for more about this and how to get involved</a>. <br><br><a href="http://www.reagiraj-bidibezbedna.mk/">Reactor</a> is the Deployment of the Week.   They are working in Macedonia to amplify issues related to harassment. Truly Harassmap has been an inspiration for many projects. We love the design. And, the team has been busy localizing Ushahidi into Macedonian. The Deployment of the Week will be posted mid-week on the blog and wiki. We&#39;ll ask you for vote on Monday/Tuesday. And, please do recommend a deployment. <br>

<br>The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs created Icons which could be used in your maps. These are free. More about that in the weekly. <br> <br><br><a href="https://wiki.ushahidi.com/display/WIKI/Weekly+19+-+August+15+-+21%2C+2012">The full weekly</a><br>
