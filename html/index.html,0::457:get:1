<br>
I just pushed some of the code we use on Crowdmap Classic up to a GitHub repo with some instructions. Check it out and let me know what you think: <a href="https://github.com/brianherbert/Ushahidi-MHI-Module" target="_blank">https://github.com/<u></u>brianherbert/Ushahidi-MHI-<u></u>Module</a> - We cannot give official support for this as an organization but I think it could give you a place to start with your project.<br>

Hello there!<br>
<br>
We are thinking about making a Ushahidi farm here, something like crowdmap,<br>
but with custom domains and in our server. Is there an easy way to do that?<br>
May i use one DB with different prefixes?<br>
<br>
I would like to hear what you think of it!<br>
<br>
Best regards,<br>
Gabriel.<br>
