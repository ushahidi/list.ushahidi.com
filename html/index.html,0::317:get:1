    <div>Hi guys,<br>
      <br>
      Still wondering if there is a way to access Haiti data in
      depersonalized way with the Ushahidi api. Any other thoughts?<br>

      <div>Hi Rob,<br>
        <br>
        I put together a preliminary app during the crisis that allowed
        any cell phone or pc with internet access to query the reports
        by category, date or location. It was never put into production,
        but was an interesting project and I have it installed on my own
        web site as a demonstration app. If it would not be a big deal,
        I would appreciate being able to connect it up to some form of
        the data again.<br>
        <br>
        Please let me know what you think.<br>
        <br>

              Havent been involved lately, but have been receiving
              errors from the Haiti api for quite some time and finally
              investigated. Looks like the interface is password
              protected now. Can this be reopened, is it viable, can I
              have access? (<a href="http://haiti.ushahidi.com/api" target="_blank">http://haiti.ushahidi.com/api</a>).<br>
