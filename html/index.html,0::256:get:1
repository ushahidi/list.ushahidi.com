Some notes:<div><ul><li>Scale is a function of design</li><li>MySQL scales quite well...when you know what you&#39;re doing but it&#39;s not very inspiring for geo-spatial work. PostgreSQL (+PostGIS) has clearly become the preferred choice for such.</li>

<li>For high traffic deployments, a factory installation won&#39;t cut it - some load balancing, caching, DB tuning etc work has to be done  in addition to exorcising ghosts that are always inherent in the machine</li><li>

The NoSQL options, e.g. Redis, are pretty good for caching (Reddit and big xxx sites)</li><li>Profiling code has provided great insights on what sections of the application are yielding beastly load times</li></ul><div>Thanks.</div>

Hello all,<div><br></div><div>First post here, not really an Ushahidi developer yet, for the moment the NGO I work with has a couple projects that use it and since we love it, we&#39;re starting customization to meet our needs (which differ a bit from the typical Crwodmap sites - it&#39;s a biking support site).</div>

An option might be to ensure that database interaction is abstracted<br>
enough that it doesn&#39;t matter what the underlying database is... and<br>
this is something that might be worth looking into.<br></div></blockquote><div><br></div><div>I&#39;d love to see some DB abstraction on Ushahidi. If possible, have a &quot;quick and dirty&quot; approach using mysql that allows a quick deployment, but as a site scales up and requires further optimizations, allow better back-ends for efficiency.</div>
