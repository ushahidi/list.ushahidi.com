hi everyone,<br><br>i started an Ushahidi map last spring to support a range of work being done for the Great Lakes. it&#39;s called the <a href="http://www.greatlakescommonsmap.org">Great Lakes Commons Map</a>.<br><br>i&#39;m hosting an event in Toronto on Sunday, February 3rd to showcase the site, but to also some needed feedback and direction. the project is very interdisciplinary and merges knowledge/skills in community mapping, digital storytelling, and of course open source technologies.<br>
<br>right now i have a pretty &#39;thin&#39; development team and i&#39;m looking for some new interest from the Ushahidi community.<br><br>if this project interests you in anyway, please consider checking out the site, getting in touch, and even coming on the 3rd if you&#39;re in the area.<br>
