Just to back up Pablo&#39;s point, even from the users&#39; point of view, focusing on the stability would be apropos at this point, as the sharing feature and import functionality have become even more important. <br><br>

With best regards,<br>-J. <br><br><div class="gmail_quote">On Tue, Mar 16, 2010 at 5:10 PM, Pablo A.

I am not sure what Max means with his phrase, but I do think we need to do a<br>
feature freeze and work on making sure that we have core functionality<br>
working properly, some examples are the &quot;Import incidents&quot; (from CSV), and<br>
the sharing of incidents between different instances.<br>
<br>
Currently we have many cases when one update to the master code breaks other<br>
stuff, ie. by uploading files that should not be uploaded (ie. config.php).<br>
My view is that many of these things came post-Haiti (which is<br>
understandable).<br>
<br>
At any rate, the clean up effort does not need to prevent others from<br>
contributing to the project, but should allow Ushahidi to have a &quot;stable&quot;<br>
version. This will become more relevant as we have more projects using the<br>
application (as in &quot;depending&quot;); my view is that they will be more inclined<br>
to stability over cutting edge features.<br>
<br>
Again, my 0,02, I know that I&#39;m seeing this more from the implementer&#39;s<br>
point of view rather than the developer&#39;s, that&#39;s why I am trying to find a<br>
way that serves both.<br>
<br>
Cheers,<br>

&gt; &gt; Cleaning up our User Interface involves the following:<br>
&gt; &gt; * Making sure our HTML is XHTML Compliant<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; I don&#39;t think that&#39;s fixing any problem we have. I&#39;m more than happy<br>
&gt; to be convinced otherwise, but in the meantime I think I&#39;ll spend time<br>
&gt; on cleaning up HTML and CSS, simplifying, optimising and making the<br>
&gt; main site as mobile-friendly as possible.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; ...as opposed to the mobile site Caleb and I have been spending some<br>
&gt; time on, which is moving to the backburner for now. (I&#39;m still hopeful<br>
&gt; for a discussion about requirements and use cases, btw)<br>
