It's not the best place for it but the idea was to show it working alongside reports. Here's a screenshot from my development environment:&nbsp;http://dl.dropbox.com/u/1938726/Screenshots/a3vb.png<div><br></div><div>All we need to make this work is a theme that will display media from checkins and it should be fine. We could white label and theme out the forms a bit on iPhone and Android to make this work a bit better. Pushing to other networks would have to be added on the platform, still.</div><div><br></div><div>We're all fans of Instagram and I think we can all agree that making reporting / checking in / sharing media as easy as Instagram is would be a big win across the board.</div><div><br></div><div>Brian</div></div>

We could hide virtually ever feature and carefully craft the few things we do expose. It could be ridiculously minimalist and, if I could just snap and upload, I would use it every day. &nbsp;It doesn't have to be a perfect instagram clone, just an easy to setup photosharing hub with a one-click experience. <br><br>Perhaps it could be useful to corporate teams, or geeky families, or friendly darknets and people of the underground. (It would not have the huge instagram social network, but I'm attracted to the idea of a smaller hub of a few people ... :)<br><br>One problem we talked about at the meetup last in SF was the fact that Ushahidi proper is not really appropriate for day to day use. Also it is just not fun to think about disaster apps all the time. But we know that, in disasters, people use what they are used to.

I went ahead and started pushing to a repository last night. Could use help with the mobile version. Anyone done an any mobile HTML5 features yet?
