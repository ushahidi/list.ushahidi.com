HI Loren and Pablo, thank you kindly for the braining on this topic.<br><br>As you can tell, we need to do some re-thinking about support models as a small Open Source organization. This means also clear communication on our wiki and website to help people get connected. Your insight into this is well-noted. <br>

<br>There were already some plans in the works to do an overhaul, so you have given us more fodder and reason to dig in. Thank you.<br><br>I could use a hand on the Forums to clean up all the open items. You are absolutely correct that we can do that better. Thank you.  If anyone would like to help out, this is greatly appreciated.  I&#39;ve been thinking a lot about feedback loops. Personally, I think that we need better Forum software, but the root cause remains - overwhelming communications channels to be improved and opportunity to better respond to community growth. For this, I hear you loudly. <br>

<br>Pablo, I would be very happy to talk with you more on this topic. Loren, thanks for also reaching out off-list. <br><br>Heather<br><br><div class="gmail_quote">On Wed, Jun 13, 2012 at 9:40 AM, Pablo A.

<br>
I have exchanged a few emails with LBell, and sometimes being on the search<br>
for Ushahidi talent I understand where the frustration comes from.<br>
Don&#39;t get me wrong, but directing someone that is not a coder to Github is<br>
not a solution, nor is saying &quot;you need a feature, hack it yourself!&quot;, which<br>
I&#39;ve heard before - very cool, yes, but unenforceable for the average user<br>
or for someone that has the intent, but does not have the time to<br>
modify/adapt/fix the code.<br>
<br>
The forums and Skype chat are fine, but they are not dependable. Sometimes<br>
you will be lucky and get Linda, Emmanuel, Dale, Brian, David, or any other<br>
&quot;top&quot; developer to reply at one particular issue - and they&#39;re always<br>
spot-on - but many times you are left with the crickets :)<br>
<br>
Ushahidi is getting bigger, and it is still moving fast, making very hard<br>
for someone to be up-to-date, and maintain a stable operation at the same<br>
time. Maybe this has not been realized yet, but when one says &quot;let&#39;s use<br>
Ushahidi&quot; in a given project, particularly a larger one, that person is<br>
making a bet. Not having a dependable support will make people think twice.<br>
<br>
I think you know where I&#39;m going with this; we are at the point where we<br>
need to think of either creating (or formalizing) a support channel that<br>
people like LBell can tap into, and start thinking of training. The former<br>
has been a need for a while, and with proper curation will improve<br>
Ushahidi&#39;s standing, and develop a revenue channel (yes, I&#39;m talking about<br>
*paid* support), for the latter, this could be a great time to do so,<br>
considering the media interest in non-traditional training.<br>
<br>
Maybe we can discuss this some more and exchange a few ideas?<br>
<br>
Best wishes,<br>
<br>
Pablo Destéfanis<br>

&gt;<br>
&gt; Hi, thanks for following up. I mentioned your post to a few people who<br>
might<br>
&gt; do contract work. Would it be acceptable to add it to the Ushahidi weekly<br>
&gt; report? This goes on the blog and reaches a wider audience. I would need a<br>
&gt; three sentence summary by 14:00 edt today for this week&#39;s post. I&#39;ve never<br>
&gt; heard of that consultant email. Sorry that I missed the reference.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; On resources:<br>
&gt; Git and the wiki are frequented<br>
&gt; We have a few skype developer chats which community members and core<br>
&gt; team folks attempt to help. Simply add me and I&#39;ll connect you<br>
&gt; (heatherleson) We also have a monthly Skype developer call. It will be<br>
June<br>
&gt; 25. More on that soon.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Regarding the forums, I agree that this is a tough avenue. It is on my<br>
list of<br>
&gt; things that need desperate cleanup and responses. For this, I extend my<br>
&gt; apology and commitment to try and respond to the needs more.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Hope this helps,<br>
&gt;<br>

&gt; &gt; Hi -<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; As a quasi follow-up to my request for developers (which garnered one<br>
&gt; &gt; response, thanks, and a suggestion to email <a href="mailto:consulting@...">consulting@...</a><br>
&gt; &gt; &lt;-- emails bounced) I&#39;m interested to know the best way to get<br>
&gt; &gt; development help if I start to delve into this on my own...<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; Case in point: Most posts on the Ushahidi forums are 1) unanswered, 2)<br>
&gt; &gt; self-answered, 3) un-moderated spam. Crickets abound.<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; I see activity elsewhere (blog, git, the new wiki), but before I<br>
&gt; &gt; commit the time here - please reassure me there is some way to get<br>
&gt; &gt; answers to stupid little questions like, how do I do X,Y,or Z?<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; Thanks,<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
