<div dir="ltr">Hi all,<div>Happy New year people, hope you enjoyed the holidays and the year is great so far. Now, before the end of 2013 there were quite a number of pushes from the community, bug fixes and pull requests. In this regard a bug fix release is due. We shall be doing a code freeze on Thursday the 16th, this gives anyone with a pull request 2 days to submit after which the release will go into testing.</div>
