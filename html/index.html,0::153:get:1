Hi Folks, <br><br>We&#39;re happy to announce the Ushahidi v2.1 Tunis Launch. There are a number of much anticipated changes including improved report UI, custom forms, optimization and more. Check out the details here: <a href="http://blog.ushahidi.com/index.php/2011/08/09/announcing-ushahidi-v2-1-tunis/">http://blog.ushahidi.com/index.php/2011/08/09/announcing-ushahidi-v2-1-tunis/</a><br>

<br>This mailing list has been fairly quiet. There is more activity on the Ushahidi Skype chat for discussions. I&#39;m looking into streamlining some of our communications channels while incorporating logs. <br><br>Let me know if you have any thoughts, preferences,<br>
