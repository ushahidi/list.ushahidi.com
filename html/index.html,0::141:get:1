I may have missed this but does the Ushahidi mailing list (developers or implementors) have an archive similar to the ones <a href="http://nabble.com">nabble.com</a> provides? I ask because as more people join the mailing list that pool of knowledge becomes impossible to access by searching through emails, it works wonders for the openMRS mailing list. In fact I just used the archive to search and reference a similar problem I had with a module upgrade.<br clear="all">
