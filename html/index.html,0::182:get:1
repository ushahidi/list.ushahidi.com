    I know this isn't an Ushahidi specific questions but thought I'd
    try:<br>
    <br>
    Does anyone know how to make more than one vector layer clickable at
    a time? Like If you have the dots and a KML layer, you can only
    click on elements from one layer at a time. Can I make it so you can
    click on both at the same time?<br>
    <br>
    Thanks,<br>
