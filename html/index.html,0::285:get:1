Hi All,<div><br></div><div>WMS support has been a requested feature for a while, and a few people have hacked various ways to get it in (Robert Buckley, Luis Hernando Aguilar, Seth Kigen)</div><div>I improved the mapping helper a while back to make it easier for plugins to add WMS base layers. However I&#39;m keen to get support for overlays into core and maybe make adding baselayers even easier.</div>

<div>Who else has worked on WMS layers? Has anyone got examples of working WMS overlays?</div><div>Has anyone checked the WMS baselayer support works? Robert Buckley did suggest something wasn&#39;t quite right, and my GIS knowledge isn&#39;t good enough to be sure I didn&#39;t mess something up.</div>

<div><br></div><div>Any help/experience anyone can share here would be great.</div><div><div><br></div><div>Code examples:</div><div><a href="https://github.com/kigen/Ushahidi-plugin-wms">https://github.com/kigen/Ushahidi-plugin-wms</a></div>
