<br><br>Join Rising Voices, Social Media Exchange (SMEX) and the New Tactics online community for an online dialogue on <a href="http://www.newtactics.org/en/dialogue/physical-spaces-catalysts-greater-citizen-participation" target="_blank"><b>Physical spaces as catalysts for greater digital citizen participation</b></a> from August 8 to 14, 2012.<br>



<br>Across the globe, new physical spaces are emerging that are acting 
as catalysts for greater citizen participation using digital 
technologies. Telecenters are going beyond providing computer access to 
communities, to providing workshops to train citizens on how to use 
digital technology effectively to promote change. Hacklabs offer a 
physical space where activists and technologists can come together to 
find innovative solutions to local problems.  These are just a few 
examples of the innovative use of physical space to encourage and 
empower greater digital citizen participation!<br>
<br>Although the internet has provided new ways for people to work 
together virtually, people are finding complementary energy from working
 face-to-face. Mobilizers and mentors for users of these spaces have a 
commitment to see their local communities become more active through the
 use of digital tools.<br>
<br>This dialogue is an opportunity to exchange innovative examples of 
how these physical spaces are being used as catalysts for greater 
citizen participation.  <br><br><b>How can you participate?</b><br>
