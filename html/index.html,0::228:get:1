Hi Robbie,<br><br><blockquote style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 0.8ex;border-left:1px solid rgb(204,204,204);padding-left:1ex" class="gmail_quote">- request logic to deal with authorities;<br></blockquote>I have described the meaning but seems not clear enough.<br>
Let me explain you.<br>Suppose you have spotted a big hole on the road.<br>You want it to be fixed.<br>You need instructions where to report it to authorities.<br>You also need a template to form your request in an appropriate language (&quot;hey, dude, you have a hole here&quot; will not make sense ;) )<br>
Fine if authorities will fix the hole after your request. But if not?<br>Then one need to write to state prosecutor. <br>When the issue is fixed you need to load a photo of fixed defect to prove it is fixed.<br>Example is here: <a href="http://rosyama.ru/20472/">http://rosyama.ru/20472/</a><br>

Dear Ushahidi developers,<br><div class="gmail_quote"><div class="gmail_quote"><br>I got experience moderating Ushahidi in this project:<br><a href="http://radiation.crowdmap.com" target="_blank">radiation.crowdmap.com</a><br>



<br>Now my attention is focused on <a href="http://rosyama.ru" target="_blank">http://rosyama.ru</a> project.<br>

The aim of the project is to improve road condition in Russia.<br><br>The algorithm of the RosYama is the following:<br>1) user marks road defect on the map and uploads a photo of defect;<br>
2) user chooses category for the defect;<br>3) RosYama generates a common request to authorities demanding to fix defect; <br>4) User can upload a reply received from authorities regarding his request;<br>5) If defect will not be fixed RosYama can help to generate a complain to state prosecutor.<br>





6) If the defect is fixed user can mark it as fixed and upload a photo of fixed defect.<br><br>RosYama is an open source project licensed under BSD license and hosted on GitHUB:<br><a href="https://github.com/RosYama/RosYama.2" target="_blank">https://github.com/RosYama/RosYama.2</a><br>







<br><a href="http://rosyama.ru/" target="_blank"></a>RosYama started from scratch and still under development.<br>There are many common features between Ushahidy and RosYama.<br>Ushahidi is a mature and worldwide known project. <br>





It would be nice to use Ushahidi for solving the same sort of problems as RosYama do.<br><br>But Ushahidi lacks important features, which are implemented in RosYama:<br>- private user profile;<br>- request logic to deal with authorities;<br>





- icons for categories (colors in Ushahidi are not expressive);<br><br>Is it hard to implement the above mentioned features in Ushahidi without modifications in architecture?<br>Is there any development work in the mentioned areas going in Ushahidi?<br>





<br>Thank you,<br><br>Denis Kulandin<br><b></b>
