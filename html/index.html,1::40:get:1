Hello Heather and Community,<br><br>Thank you for your encouragement and for introducing me to the <a href="http://www.buildingbridges.co.ke">BuildingBridges</a> project in Kenya.  That introduced me to the <a href="http://www.peacenetkenya.or.ke">Peace and Development Network</a>, Kenya, a much older organization.  I am learning a lot... there is a lot to learn.  The AlNur.crowdmap offers an opportunity to think about the messaging and connectivity that may help prevent conflict. <br>

<br>Should I be working with an Ushahidi mentor or is it ok to ask questions and explore lessons learned right here in this forum?<br><br>For Example:  <br>1)  When someone submits a report, I want to be able to automatically email them back right when I approve their report.  Is there a way to do this now?  How?   Wishlist:  It would be great to set-up an email template, then customize it if I want to add something based on their message.<br>

<br>2)  From time to time, I want to be able to mass email everyone who submitted a report.  Doable? How?<br><br>3)  Are there any Ushahidi implementations that encourage discussion among people who submit reports?   Are public comments to a report possible?  Wishlist: threaded discussion list associated with the map.<br>

<br>4)  What if the best thing one can do with a widespread event is to focus it, like a beach ball bouncing above a crowd.  Maybe sister cities can be depicted together and they could choose to do neighborhood-wide events on the same day...<br>

<br>5)  How do reporters from print media cover specific Ushahidi crisis map reports?  Do they ask the superadmin for contact info to allow them to interview?<br><br>I look forward to your thoughts.<br><br>Sincerely,<br>
Donna<br>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font><span style="font-family:arial,sans-serif">I am here in the SF Bay
area -- not far from Chris Stevens&#39; home.<span>   I designed</span> this Ushahidi Crowdmap to show a personal,
neighbor-to-neighbor action through a
symbol, a candle in the window.  Nobel Laureates all say peace starts from within —  they may be right, let&#39;s start here.<br></span></font></p><p class="MsoNormal"><font><span style="font-family:arial,sans-serif">Some people at Meedan.net have offered to translate into Arabic and from Arabic into English.<br>



<br> Candles in windows were used to good effect in Poland in
the &#39;80s when Solidarity was placed under martial law, and again more effectively in the Czech
Velvet Revolution.<span>   </span>When I
used it to send a message to the people of Iraq in 1990, some 10,000 Americans
joined me (pre twitter)... now I ask you to place a candle in your window
each night through the end of this month, and map yourself as participants on the
Crowdmap -- all the way across the world.</span></font></p><p class="MsoNormal"><font><span style="font-family:arial,sans-serif">I ask for your help.<br><br>Sincere thanks, Donna<br></span></font></p><font><span style="font-family:arial,sans-serif"><a href="https://alnur.crowdmap.com/" target="_blank">https://alnur.crowdmap.com/</a></span></font><span class="HOEnZb"><font color="#888888"><br>
