hi everyone,<br><br>i started an Ushahidi map last spring to support a range of work being done for the Great Lakes. it&#39;s called the <a href="http://www.greatlakescommonsmap.org" target="_blank">Great Lakes Commons Map</a>.<br>

<br>i&#39;m
 hosting an event in Toronto on Sunday, February 3rd to showcase the 
site, but to also some needed feedback and direction. the project is 
very interdisciplinary and merges knowledge/skills in community mapping,
 digital storytelling, and of course open source technologies.<br><br>right now i have a pretty &#39;thin&#39; development team and i&#39;m looking for some new interest from the Ushahidi community.<br><br>if
 this project interests you in anyway, please consider checking out the 
site, getting in touch, and even coming on the 3rd if you&#39;re in the 
area.<br><br>event link:<br><a href="http://impossible.ws/event/collaborative-mapping-using-place-based-storytelling-connect-our-great-lakes" target="_blank">http://impossible.ws/event/collaborative-mapping-using-place-based-storytelling-connect-our-great-lakes</a><br>
