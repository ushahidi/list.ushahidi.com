<div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; border-collapse: collapse; "><br></span></div>I am an Open Source Geospatial Consultant, involved in OSGeo and OpenStreetMap (among others). I am good at OpenLayers, Postgres/PostGIS, geoserver and javascript (preferably jQuery) and PHP.<br>
<br>I have testdriven Ushahidi and already have some stuff ready that I would like to share:<br>- Dutch translation, 80% ready<br>- Fixes for the issues: #1173, #1174, #1177 (needs discussion first) and #1178<br>- I made the main.php and several other pages w3c valid<br>
- I am currently working at solving issues #1169 and #1170<br>- I have some ideas on letting admins add wms layers</span><div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; border-collapse: collapse; ">- I want to enhance the <a href="http://geonames.org">geonames.org</a> geocoding process by parsing rss first to detect already geocoded feed-items and then only parsing the not geocoded items through geonames<br>
- I am also in another project for open source heatmaps. I read that this is still a wish, I would be glad to help!<br><br>Now, I simply did a git clone and started working in the downloaded environment. I myself am a long time SVN user and I am having difficulty understanding how to create a patch in git. Because I would prefer to set up a patch that can be tested by your team before ever being granted commit rights. This procedure is often used in open source communities to determine the validity of patches before granting new developers full rights on a repository.<br>
<br></span></div><div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; border-collapse: collapse; ">- Should I work on trunk or on the 2.0 branch?<br>- What is the best to hand changes,fixes and patches over to the team for evaluation?<br>
- I have been on the irc-channel, but there was little activity, what timezone and time of day would be best to enter irc-chat? And if other channels are more active (f.i. Skype) how can I join them?</span><br clear="all">
