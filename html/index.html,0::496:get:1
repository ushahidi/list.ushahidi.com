Hello all!<div><br></div><div>I&#39;m Caleb, a computer science student at the University of Virginia. Recently I&#39;ve been working on deploying Ushahidi in Maryland to help organize the relief effort after Hurricane Sandy, but now I&#39;ve decided to shift gears and instead work on implementing a shortest path algorithm in the 3.0 build. It would be especially useful in the immediate wake of a disaster when disaster <span></span>victims need to be picked up or resources need to be delivered.</div>
<div><br></div><div>I&#39;m emailing the dev list now to 1) gauge interest in such a feature, and 2) make sure that no one is already working on it. Contact me with your thoughts, or let me know if you want to push back on the idea.</div>
<div><br></div><div>Best,</div><div>Caleb</div><div><br></div><div><br><br></div>
