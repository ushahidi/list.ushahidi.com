Hi everyone, <br><br>Our Deployment of the Week comes from Nepal - <a href="http://nepalmonitor.org">nepalmonitor.org</a>. This team have been working hard on customization and training. <br> <br><br>If you are a corruption mapper, Transparency International has mini-grants which you could apply for. I dream of all your civil society and social entrepreneurship projects getting funding to test. Maybe you will be able to build something with this.<br>

<br><a href="http://blog.ushahidi.com/index.php/2012/09/05/weekly-mini-grants-community-news/">http://blog.ushahidi.com/index.php/2012/09/05/weekly-mini-grants-community-news/</a><br><br>I posted two reports on the blog that investigate best practices and impact. These reports have really shaped us as we move forward. How can we make it easier to use Ushahidi to help you do the things you want to do?   <br>

If you are a wiki person and would like to help out let me know.<br>

<br>On the translation front, we are hoping for some help with Swahili this week. On September 17th, we will do an election monitoring simulation with Ushahid for the .ke byelections. Having more Swahili will help us prepare for the March elections in 2013 - <a href="https://www.transifex.net/projects/p/ushahidi-localizations/">https://www.transifex.net/projects/p/ushahidi-localizations/</a><br>
