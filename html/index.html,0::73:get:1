Max I understand what you mean. Definitely a better idea to have the report title in the bubble for single reports - makes sense.<br><br><br><br><div class="gmail_quote">On Thu, Jun 17, 2010 at 10:39 AM, Max Froumentin <span dir="ltr">&lt;<a href="mailto:max@...">max@...</a>&gt;</span> wrote:<br>

is specific to my install (which has places as reports),<br>
you would normally have the title of the report, whatever it is.<br>
<br>
Having several titles is possible, for nitems &lt; n, too. I&#39;ll look into it.<br>

&gt; Question: isn&#39;t it redundant to show the name of the city? After all that&#39;s<br>
&gt; why we have the map. I liked having the title, and maybe several titles if<br>
&gt; we have several items on the cluster, until items &gt; n, when you show the<br>
&gt; total number, or -even better- the last m reports, indicating there&#39;s a<br>
&gt; total of n.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Maybe we are hitting the mark where the ideal solution depends entirely in<br>
&gt; what we are using the instance for. When you have an implementation in mind,<br>
&gt; you develop a sort of tunnel vision (by experience!). Maybe this needs to be<br>
&gt; a configuration option, or an &quot;easily modifiable&quot; part at implementation<br>
&gt; time.<br>

&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; Hi devs,<br>
&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; For a local install I&#39;ve changed the way the content of the map<br>
&gt;&gt; markers popups are displayed.<br>
&gt;&gt; See before/after screenshots. The change is simple: if there&#39;s only<br>
&gt;&gt; one report, then display the report title instead of &quot;1 Report&quot;. Also,<br>
&gt;&gt; remove the &lt;ul&gt; since there&#39;s always only one item.<br>
&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; That fix is so obvious to me, that there must be a catch somewhere.<br>
&gt;&gt; That&#39;s why I&#39;m submitting it here before committing... Let me know<br>
&gt;&gt; what you think.<br>
&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; Cheers,<br>
&gt;&gt; Max.<br>
