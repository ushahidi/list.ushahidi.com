Hi everyone, <br><br>It&#39;s been an honour to meet community folks in person in Tokyo, London and Oxford. I posted about some of the events on the <a href="http://blog.ushahidi.com/index.php/2012/07/09/community-update-plans-events-and-code/">blog </a>and <a href="https://wiki.ushahidi.com/display/WIKI/Weekly+13+-+June+13+-+July+9%2C+2012">wiki </a><br>

<br>A few key notes:<br><ul><li>The forums software has been updated. You may need to change your password when logging. <br></li><li>Ushahidi is looking for some desktop publishing help (Paid short term work). Please contact me directly.</li>

<li>There are upcoming events in Seattle (tomorrow) and Portland (July 20th)</li><li>One thing that the election hackathon taught me is that we need to build a list of things that researchers should write about. It would be good to have a short list of recommended research topics that would benefit the community. Ideas?</li>

</ul><br>I was on course for the past few weeks studying Media Regulation. The Ushahidi weekly will return, finally.<br><br>Have a great week<br><br clear="all">Heather<br>-- <br>Heather Leson<br>Director of Community Engagement<br>
