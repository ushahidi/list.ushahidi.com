Hi, just want to introduce myself and let people know about a developer job. <br><br>I work for Project for Public Spaces, an international nonprofit community planning and design firm.<br>
We focus on Placemaking, a bottom-up approach community-centered planning, which in digital terms is all about p2p, crowdsourcing, and community mapping.<br><br>The digital group I&#39;m starting did our first &quot;Digital Placemaking&quot; beta with a simple version of Ushahidi in August of 2010, here&#39;s a very brief post about the result of this project: <br>
<a href="http://www.pps.org/blog/a-focus-on-place-for-downtown-baltimores-new-master-plan/">http://www.pps.org/blog/a-focus-on-place-for-downtown-baltimores-new-master-plan/</a><br><br><b>*The Job*</b><br>Right now, in March, we&#39;re doing a public event in NYC with the Institute for Urban Design.<br>
I&#39;m looking for someone right away.<br>The job description is on this google doc: <br><a class="info" href="http://goo.gl/AILFt" title="goo.gl/AILFt">goo.gl/AILFt</a><br>(We&#39;re also looking for a developer w/ WordPress experience, too! It would be great to find one person for all of this.)<br>
<br>Checking the archives for this list I don&#39;t see any job postings, so hopefully this isn&#39;t out of place. <br>
If so, please let me know where else to share this with the Ushahidi community.<br><br>Contact me with any questions &amp; please pass this on to anyone who might be looking for this type of work.<br><br>Thank you,<br>Daniel<br>
