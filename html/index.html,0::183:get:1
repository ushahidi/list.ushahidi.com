Pretty sure that&#39;s an openlayers limitation.  Figured the easiest approach to deal with it was to parse the kml and pull the points / lines / polygons in as full-on Ushahidi reports.  Of course that&#39;s using a highly subjective definition of &quot;easiest.&quot;  <div>

    I know this isn&#39;t an Ushahidi specific questions but thought I&#39;d
    try:<br>
    <br>
    Does anyone know how to make more than one vector layer clickable at
    a time? Like If you have the dots and a KML layer, you can only
    click on elements from one layer at a time. Can I make it so you can
    click on both at the same time?<br>
