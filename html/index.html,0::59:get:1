<div>Hi David,</div><div><br></div>Thanks for the thought. Simply put, the auto upgrade process needs to be reworked. <div><br></div><div>I&#39;m thinking we emulate Drupal&#39;s upgrade process. Its much inline with your idea.</div>

<div><br></div><div>An overview page that describes what is going to happen. Actions that needs to be taken by the user.

<div><br></div><div>Then it gives a log of activities that have happened.

As we get closer to pushing out the 1.1.0 bug fix release, I just<br>
thought I&#39;d bring up a few points/issues for discussion.<br>
<br>
1. We need to need to make upgrading as intuitive as possible. If<br>
anything we need to emulate the &#39;Installation&#39; process to make<br>
everything as clear as possible. We should probably detail all the<br>
files that are being replaced too instead of an invisible process.<br>
<br>
2. Upgrading the database. I had the following ideas:<br>
        - Part of the upgrade process should probably include dumping/backing<br>
up the old schema. The system itself should include a &#39;Backup<br>
Database&#39; option in the Admin interface.<br>
        - We need to run sql upgrades separately instead of using one upgrade.sql file<br>
        - Also should probably rename the sql upgrade files using the<br>
following format, upgrade.X.Y.sql where X = current and Y =<br>
upgrade_to. This way we can perform a &#39;For..&#39; Loop with &#39;function<br>
_upgrade_tables(X, Y)&#39; until the most recent version is in place.<br>
<br>
3. Because a lot of people make major modifications to the View files<br>
we should probably make this clear in the first step. In the near<br>
future the most commonly altered views should probably be in the<br>
themes folder too so that an upgrade doesn&#39;t flip the look of the site<br>
back to the vanilla/default look and feel.<br>
<br>
4. Because of slow download speeds and the fact that the zip file is<br>
about +2MB big, each upgrade should probably be incremental too. This<br>
way we can push out small fixes quickly and easily. We can do a diff<br>
between tags using this command to get only the modified/new files.<br>
<br>
        &gt; zip /ushahidi.zip $(git diff --name-only -a 1.0.0 1.0.1)<br>
<br>
<br>
Does anyone have ideas for an upgrade process we can try to emulate<br>
(besides WordPress of course)... ?<br>
<br>
<br>
Thanks,<br>
David.<br>
