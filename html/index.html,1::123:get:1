<br><br><div dir="ltr"><div><div><div>Hi everyone,<br><br></div>This is my first submission to the mailing list after reading for a while but I thought this might be of interest to others here. My organization, the <a href="http://www.thesentinelproject.org" target="_blank">Sentinel Project</a>, has just launched an online course called <a href="https://sentinelproject.herokuapp.com/course" target="_blank">Introduction to Technology for Human Rights</a>, which begins on June 10. It has been designed with activists, human rights defenders, development professionals, and journalists in mind. The topics cover basic principles for successfully incorporating technology into a human rights campaign and is introductory in nature so no specific technical skills are required - everyone is welcome.<br>


<br></div>If you can, please forward this on to any other relevant mailing lists or organizations where you think there might be interested people. We really appreciate any help!<br><br></div>     - Chris<br><div><div><div>

<p>The Sentinel Project is excited to offer the brand new course <a href="https://sentinelproject.herokuapp.com/course" target="_blank">Introduction to Technology for Human Rights</a>
 running for five weeks from 10 June to 14 July 2013. Participants will 
learn about the relationship between technological tools and human 
rights through a combination of theory, principles, and real-world case 
studies from Kenya, Iran, and the Arab Spring. This will leave them 
equipped with the knowledge needed to incorporate technology into their 
own campaigns.</p>
<p>Activists are constantly adapting to use technology in new ways as it
 continually impacts the struggle to defend human rights worldwide. As 
mobile phone usage and internet access continue to rapidly increase, 
even in less-developed countries, technology has become an essential 
part of the landscape, influencing both the economy and civil society.</p>
<p><b>Who should take this course?</b></p>
<p>The ability to use new tools to their full potential while also 
recognizing their limitations and inherent risks has become essential 
for human rights defenders everywhere. From crisis mapping to social 
media to satellite imagery, people working in fields like human rights, 
international development, and journalism need to understand the 
opportunities and adversities they face when using technology to promote
 change.</p>
