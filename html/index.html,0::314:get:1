<br>
Havent been involved lately, but have been receiving errors from the Haiti api for quite some time and finally investigated. Looks like the interface is password protected now. Can this be reopened, is it viable, can I have access? (<a href="http://haiti.ushahidi.com/api" target="_blank">http://haiti.ushahidi.com/api</a><u></u>).<br>
