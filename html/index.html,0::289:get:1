<p>Master is the stable branch.<br>
active dev is on develop</p>
<p>Not sure how pfff compares with hphp.. Both came out of Facebook.<br>
The pfff code map seemed much the same as the output from the x debug profiler.. But i guess is visualizing something a little different</p>

&gt; Great to see someone else doing this too. I had a play static checking using<br>

oh, wow, I guess i am out of date! I thought I checked the most recent<br>
code (master), will have to check again!<br>
Sorry for a double reporting. what branch is this in? is master not<br>
the most recent best code?<br>
<br>
&gt; It&#39;d be great to get this set up on the QA server so basic errors like this<br>
&gt; don&#39;t hang round long.<br>
well i am using hiphop for php, but pfff seems that it might be lighter weight.<br>
