Hi Bill,<div>I&#39;m not sure that MySQL really is the slow down here. I&#39;ve been deep into frontend code recently there&#39;s a lot of candidates for the slow down: inefficient php, or inefficient use of mysql, the way we load all our JS, Openlayers just being a heavy beast, etc.</div>

<div>Re 3.0 and alternatives to php/mysql. I think main advantage of PHP for us is how easy it is for people to deploy (and maybe how easy it is to hack). I don&#39;t know if we&#39;d want to ditch PHP. But I&#39;d definitely consider running postgres/postgis instead of mysql. There&#39;s still a trade of on ease of deployments, but postgis is pretty easy to get up and running.</div>

Ushahidi a year ago:<br>
<br>
Why maintain the connection to MySQL?<br>
<br>
I understand the deep integration with PHP, and that most of the<br>
original developers probably come from that kind of background.<br>
However, the MySQL backend is a real drag on the overall<br>
responsiveness of the system. No app I&#39;ve deployed has taken longer to<br>
load up a map than my ushahidi instances, and I can lay much of the<br>
blame on the fact that spatial data is an afterthought for MySQL,<br>
buckled on instead of built from the ground up. As much as it&#39;s an<br>
industry standard, MySQL is being lapped in speed by PostgreSQL,<br>
SQLite and any number of NoSQL options. And it doesn&#39;t have anywhere<br>
near the spatial processing and analysis capabilities of PostGIS.<br>
<br>
You have acres of code fully-formed. I get that. But while everyone&#39;s<br>
talking about a reboot for 3.0, why not explore a basis in PostGIS or<br>
CouchDB? Why not jump out of the PHP/MySQL box completely and build<br>
with jekyll or node.js - something that represents the new paradigm<br>
for speed in delivering managed content?<br>
<br>
This has been a voice from the peanut gallery, and you may have<br>
already covered this at length. I&#39;ve piped up now because I want to<br>
see Ushahidi improve. It&#39;s still an amazing tool.<br>
