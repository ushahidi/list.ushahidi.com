All this Oauth is completely foreign to me - but wanted to chime in on https: Will https will be an option and not a requirement?<div><br></div><div>We are looking at multiple deployments where cost is more a concern than security -- and https will require ponying up 30% more on hosting costs...

<div dir="ltr"><div>I think the guts of this is that there isn&#39;t really a good alternative to Oauth 2, and it probably does the job, so we might have to live with it.</div><div><br></div>2 vs 3 legged is basically a matter of what&#39;re you using a it for: 2 legged only authenticates an app, 3 legged authenticates the user and app..<div>




I didn&#39;t think 3 legged oauth really demanded a full redirect everytime, unless the tokens are expiring far too often. Seems like Feedly might be doing it wrong. They seemed to pull all the data fresh each time, rather than just using OAuth to authenticate a user and grab new data.</div>




<div><br></div><div>Looking at different methods and trying to work out what we&#39;d use for what. Its a little different from a lot of use cases since we&#39;re using the API for our own app, not just 3rd party ones.</div>




<div>Oauth 2 has an option called &#39;resource owner&#39; where you basically send user/pass to the API and get back a bearer token you use from then. This could work for the official js app, since it avoids any weird redirect and the token is basically just session id in another form. The official mobile apps might also use this method.</div>




<div>Other methods might make more sense for other &#39;external&#39; apps consuming data from an ushahidi install.</div><div><br></div><div>Watched through this video today <a href="https://blog.apigee.com/detail/oauth_20_don_t_throw_the_baby_out_with_the_bathwater_video_slides" target="_blank">https://blog.apigee.com/detail/oauth_20_don_t_throw_the_baby_out_with_the_bathwater_video_slides</a> .. quite long but I&#39;m starting to have a handle on how OAuth 2 works now. </div>
