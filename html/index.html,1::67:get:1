<br>
Hi all,<br>
<br>
as many of you are aware, the call for papers for next year&#39;s ISCRAM (12-15 May 2013) in Baden-Baden in Germany has been out for a while now.<br>
<br>
I am chairing a track that might be of great interest for the crisis mappers community, and I&#39;d love to see some papers (full or work in progress) submitted; I am sure there is an extensive body of knowledge and experience hidden in the crisis mappers network and other VTCs!<br>


<br>

<br>
DL Full papers: Dec 1 (extended)<br>
DL Work in Progress: Jan 15<br>
<br>
Cheers,<br>
Sigi.<br>
<br>
PS: If you don&#39;t think you can write a paper but still want to contribute, we are also always happy about reviewers! :)<br>

Introduction of the track<br>
<br>
There is a critical need to improve the quality, effectiveness, appropriateness, and accessibility of information for international crisis response and management in the face of devastating disasters. Information systems have great potential to support the complex community of humanitarian stakeholders involved in these efforts. However, the potential of these systems remains largely unrealized, in part because design assumptions and constraints from business systems may be incompatible with the success criteria of humanitarian information systems. Developing a clearer understanding of the specific needs of humanitarian practitioners, beneficiaries and funders is critical to system design, as is consideration of the ways people work and the values they bring to humanitarian environments. Both non-technical and technical aspects of system design must take into account the criteria for success of international humanitarian crisis response organizations. These criteria can differ widely from the success criteria found in the business world.<br>


To exploit the great potential of technological systems in crisis situations, designs must be based on an understanding of how response and management activities are actually performed, as well as the unique strategies, constraints and motivations of operation within the international humanitarian environment. At ISCRAM 2012, a special session on “Improving Information Systems for Crisis Response and Management through Modeling and Analysis of Humanitarian Workflow” provided a number of concrete examples of the differences of practices and strategies between businesses and leading humanitarian organizations. For example, NGO practitioners revealed that a key operational tactic would be to keep as many options open as possible, as opposed to finding the most efficient (in terms of time and money) path and focusing on that “optimal” option in a commercial operation.<br>


Keeping with the theme of this year’s conference on integrative and analytic approaches to crisis and emergency management systems, we are especially interested in analytic and unconventional work that will spur lively debate and fruitful discussion of how best to analyze and integrate humanitarian success factors, hidden work, and values into system design. Critical historical reviews, meta-analyses, and visions for the future of ISCRAM research are also invited. The review process will emphasize intellectual merit and humanitarian impact. In addition to presenting their papers, elected successful proposers will be invited to participate in a continuation of the special session begun at ISCRAM 2012.<br>


<br>
Track topics<br>
 Understanding the hidden work and values within humanitarian response operations that are relevant to overall design of the work system, as well as resulting workflow needs and requirements.<br>
 Uncovering the unique meaning and characteristic of “effectiveness” within humanitarian response operations, logistics and information flows.<br>
 Reveal the underlying drivers of success for designing humanitarian systems.<br>
 Evaluating the differences between humanitarian and business work systems for defining “effective” operations.<br>
 Uncovering and contrasting the critically diverse meanings and design assumptions behind values such as sustainability, optimization, accountability, transparency, and uncertainty within business and humanitarian systems.<br>


 Identifying the underlying constraints introduced by business systems that create ineffectiveness within humanitarian systems.<br>
 Revealing critically differing approaches to decision-making for humanitarian operations versus business operations, and the impact on system design.<br>
 Meeting intra- and inter-organizational system management challenges in the humanitarian environment.<br>
 Articulating robust, flexible, responsive and resilient approaches for humanitarian systems, including Operations Research, modeling and simulation<br>

<br>
ISCRAM2013 is soliciting three types of submission:<br>
1.      Full research papers, which will be double blind peer reviewed.  It is intended that these will report completed work which can be assessed to the highest academic standards.  Such papers should be no more than 10 pages with figures &amp; tables (~5000 words)<br>


2.      Work in progress and discussion paper which will be subjected to a light peer review to ensure clarity.  Such papers should be no more than 5 pages with figures &amp; tables (~2500 words)<br>
3.      Practitioner reports and discussions which raise issues, examples and case studies of importance in responding to and managing crises.  These submissions will be subject to a light peer review to ensure clarity. Such papers should be submitted in the form of an extended abstract (maximum two pages, ~ 1200 words). All practitioner reports should be submitted via the dedicated “Practitioner report track”.<br>


Note that the designation of the paper and its reviewing will be indicated in the conference proceedings.  Also we are not trying to create some concept of first and second quality papers.  Rather we are aware that some report finished work which can be assessed in the sense of full peer review and contribution to research, while others offer ideas and thoughts which will stimulate discussion at ISCRAM conferences.  The latter are vital if we are to make the conference valuable for shaping our subject.<br>


Note that the ISCRAM MS Word template for submissions is available at <a href="http://www.iscram.org/iscram2013" target="_blank">http://www.iscram.org/iscram2013</a><br>
