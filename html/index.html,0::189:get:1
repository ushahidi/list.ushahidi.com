    Also please see attached a patch that will fix /admin/upgrade from
    crashing if this scenario happens again.&nbsp; I can also submit a pull
    request if you want.<br>

    On another note, I am not sure why yall are passing the ip address
    as a parameter to the call home url, as if you actually wanted the
    ip address that the machine calling home from was you could just get
    that from the web server, and it also raised a, "why are they
    collecting this PII?"<br>
