Happy New year everyone, <br><br>I&#39;m in Nairobi to cowork and plan community actions for the coming year. For this, I need your help. <br><br>We have a short survey to ask for your input - what would make your community experiences better? What programs would you like us to build? What works, what doesn&#39;t?<br>
