<div dir="ltr"><div dir="ltr"><div><div><div><div><div><div>hi everyone - i&#39;m looking for Ushahidi 
maps that were used in running a campaign around a proposed project with
 environmental harm.<br></div>i&#39;m trying to get a NGO here in toronto to
 use the deployment i started - Great Lakes Commons Map - for their 
campaign about a oil pipeline (Line 9 - tar sands oil - which is 
actually also being worked on by a host of other citizen groups).<br>
<br></div>i&#39;m trying to make the case for this NGO to use my deployment 
(since it has many water threats) so that they can get more people 
engaged in the campaign and spread the work around (typical NGO burnout 
seems to be the norm). <br>
<br></div>as part of my pitch i&#39;m looking for related deployments that 
used place-based, collaborative, rich media tools to do public 
education, engagement, and a campaign against a proposed threat. <br><br></div>suggestions, links, and comments welcomed. <br>
<br></div>thanks,<br>paul<br></div><a href="http://www.greatlakescommonsmap.org" target="_blank">http://www.greatlakescommonsmap.org</a></div></div><div class="gmail_extra"><br><br><div class="gmail_quote">On Mon, Apr 15, 2013 at 3:40 PM, Heather Leson <span dir="ltr">&lt;<a href="mailto:hleson@..." target="_blank">hleson@...</a>&gt;</span> wrote:<br>

The team at OpenIR is available on the 17th to talk about their work with Ushahidi and the environment. They&#39;ve had two deployments using Ushahidi  (Hurricane Sandy and the Jakarta Floods). <br>
