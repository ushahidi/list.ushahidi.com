I think a plugin dev could take this a step further and have it automatically set up categories with the official category names (if they are somewhere) and corresponding icons. It might be easier for deployers to then go in and simply remove the ones that aren’t relevant to their deployment.</div><div><br></div><div>I think plugin development for V3 might not be quite ready but I would say this one gets my +1.</div><div><br></div><div>Brian Herbert</div></div>
