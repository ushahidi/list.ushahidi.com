Trying to get my hands on ushahidi plugins dev. how do you know which ushahidi events are available. Like this one <div><br></div><div>Event::add(&#39;ushahidi_action.report_edit&#39;, array($this, &#39;_report_form_submit&#39;)); <div>

<br></div><div>which hooks into the report_edit form, how do you know the others that exist.</div><div><br></div><div>Gracia!<br><br><div class="gmail_quote">On Mon, Jun 7, 2010 at 9:01 PM, David Kobia <span dir="ltr">&lt;<a href="mailto:david@...">david@...</a>&gt;</span> wrote:<br>

<blockquote class="gmail_quote" style="margin:0 0 0 .8ex;border-left:1px #ccc solid;padding-left:1ex;">Ushahidi Plugins are essentially Kohana Modules - no difference,<br>
except that we&#39;re placing markers in the code to allow the plugins to<br>
hook into Ushahidi&#39;s core. You can write new controllers and views<br>
without using hooks and you are correct about being able to do<br>
something like <a href="http://example.com/ushahidi/facebook" target="_blank">http://example.com/ushahidi/facebook</a> as long as you<br>
adhere to Kohana&#39;s cascading filesystem. The plugin folder essentially<br>
mirrors the main application folder.<br>
<br>
As far as skills required to develop plugins... yes PHP is necessary.<br>

&gt; How different/similar are Ushahidi plugins from Kohana<br>
&gt; Modules/plugins? What extra functionality is available in Ushahidi<br>
&gt; Plugins that cannot be accomplished with Kohana&#39;s.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; What skills/knowledge are required to develop plugins? Is proficiency<br>
&gt; in PHP a must?<br>

&gt;&gt; How do users find plugins - will there be a central database ala wordpress?  How are plugins updated over time?<br>
&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; And just to make sure I understand the documentation - it&#39;s possible to write plugins that add completely new controllers / views without using hooks - i.e. <a href="http://example.com/ushahidi/facebook" target="_blank">http://example.com/ushahidi/facebook</a> by just having the views and controllers directories laid out correctly, right?<br>

&gt;&gt;&gt; Hi Folks,<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; David and I are organizing for a screen cast that will cover Ushahidi Plugins.  The screencast will basically be a conversation between David and I where we&#39;ll discuss the plugin system and do some diagraming/visuals along the way. Our hope is to produce a screen cast that will cover the basics of the Ushahidi Plugin system and give a general overview of how to create one.<br>


&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; Please reply with any questions you have about the system that you&#39;d like to see covered.  For those of you already familiar with the system, if you think of a question that would be helpful, you can send it on too.<br>


&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; Here are a few questions to get the ball rolling:<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; How has the plugin architecture altered the Ushahidi core platform (code-wise or directory-wise)?<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; What is a hook?<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; What is a filter?<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; How do I handle database changes or updates needed for my plugin?<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; How do I get started writing my own plugin?<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; Please send all questions in no later than Friday (June 4) of this week. We&#39;ll try to cover as much of them as we can during the screen cast.<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; Cheers!<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
