HI folks. We have had a super busy week!  Normally I send summaries to each of these lists separately, but today we have some big moving parts and wanted to connect you all. <br><br><br>Headlines:<br><ul><li>Crowdmap&#39;s Public Beta is Monday, May 6th - see the new version (docs on the wiki) <a href="https://wiki.ushahidi.com/display/WIKI/Crowdmap" target="_blank">https://wiki.ushahidi.com/display/WIKI/Crowdmap</a></li>

<li>Rose did a review of it - &quot;<font>With upgrades, it
frequently seems features become more complex; one can lose their
sense of direction when there is an general feeling of unease and
awkwardness the changes are so difficult to become accustomed to<font>.</font></font><font>This upgrade has been very
smooth one. The new release has been a joy to work with. I find it
very interactive, and it has an intuitive flow that is easy to adjust
to.<font>  I am now better</font> equipped to customize my map as I see fit<font>, and I</font> am thrilled<font> with</font> the possibilities this upgrade presents.</font>&quot;</li></ul><ul><li>2.7 launch - this was posted by Angela on the Developer list. For others see the blog - <a href="http://blog.ushahidi.com/2013/05/02/ushahidi-version-2-7-bamako/">http://blog.ushahidi.com/2013/05/02/ushahidi-version-2-7-bamako/</a></li>

<li>Weekly report of things around the world including Deployment of the Week from Great Lake Commons - <a href="http://blog.ushahidi.com/2013/05/01/weekly-crowdmap-teaser-omidyar-report-on-entrepreneurship-in-africa/" target="_blank">http://blog.ushahidi.com/2013/05/01/weekly-crowdmap-teaser-omidyar-report-on-entrepreneurship-in-africa/</a><br>


</li></ul>Umati Research:<br><br>We&#39;d like to invite you to attend a
 Google Hangout. Ihub Research has been 
conducting studies around the Kenyan elections. They will be sharing 
some of their finding on Umati and Monitoring Dangerous Speech.<br>
<br>The Event is Tuesday, May 7th.  Details: <a href="http://blog.ushahidi.com/2013/04/26/umati-google-hangout-monitoring-dangerous-speech/" target="_blank">http://blog.ushahidi.com/2013/04/26/umati-google-hangout-monitoring-dangerous-speech/</a><br>




<br>Corruption Research:<br>Lastly, I have been rewriting big sections of <a href="http://wiki.ushahidi.com">wiki.ushahidi.com</a> to include more details on topical maps and how to kits. The big first bite is about Corruption Mappers. I posted some hot data stats about the maps: <a href="https://wiki.ushahidi.com/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=8355984">https://wiki.ushahidi.com/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=8355984</a><br>

<ul><li>maps reviewed 28</li><li>total reports 6780</li><li>number of total categories across all the maps 463</li><li>Country with the most maps: India (3)</li><li>projects that are using categories for locations (instead of layers): 4 – Colombia, Brasil, Albania, Kosovo</li>

<li>Map with the most reports: Zabatak (Egypt), followed by Kallxo (Kosovo) and One De Olho Nas Emendas (Brasil)</li></ul>If you would like to help on election mapper stats, I could use a hand next week. (basically search, document and compare) It is sadly manual but super interesting to see the examples around the world. <br>

<br>All the best, <br><br>Heather <br clear="all"><br>-- <br>Heather Leson<br>Director of Community Engagement<br><b>Ushahidi</b><br><a href="mailto:hleson@..." target="_blank">hleson@...</a><br><a href="http://www.ushahidi.com" target="_blank">www.ushahidi.com</a> and <a href="https://wiki.ushahidi.com" target="_blank">https://wiki.ushahidi.com</a><br>
