      So I think the problem with the wiki page is that it doesn't talk
      about the readme.txt file that's needed for Ushahidi to recognize
      the folder as containing a plugin. That does need to be changed.<br>
      <br>
      I've attached a hello world plugin. Drop the <i>helloworld</i>
      folder into the <i>/plugins</i> folder of your ushahidi install
      then activate it on the back-end. When you look at the main page
      you should see "Hello World" in big letters on the sites home
      page.<br>
      <br>
      I hope that helps.<span><font color="#888888"><br>

        <div>Also, the instructions on this page make no mention of the

            What do you want your plugin to do. <br>
            <br>
            Also the documentation looks correct to me. Can you be more
            specific about the trouble your having? Are you having run
            time errors, or are things just not functioning like you
            want?<br>
            <br>
            Thanks,<br>

              Hi folks,<br>
              <br>
              I'm based in Canada and I'm trying to write Ushahidi
              plugins. I specifically need info about what class and
              library files are needed to make a plugin work, and <br>
              also some examples on how to create a plugin.<br>
              <br>
              I've searched online extensively for info on writing
              Ushahidi plugins/Kohana plugins but haven't found any
              adequate info<br>
              on how to do this. I also followed the documentation at<br>
              <a href="https://wiki.ushahidi.com/display/WIKI/How+To+Write+A+Plugin" target="_blank">https://wiki.ushahidi.com/<u></u>display/WIKI/How+To+Write+A+<u></u>Plugin</a>
              to write a plugin but it doesn't work. This documentation
              page also needs<br>
              updating or revising because the instructions don't work.&nbsp;
              <br>
              <br>
              I've also asked Ushahidi developers but haven't heard back
              from them.&nbsp; Can anyone help me? Thanks.<br>
              <br>
