</p><p class=""><span style="font-size:11pt;font-family:&#39;Times New Roman&#39;;color:rgb(14,0,45)">Hi all,</span></p>

<p class=""><span style="font-size:11pt;font-family:&#39;Times New Roman&#39;;color:rgb(14,0,45)">It’s been almost 5 months since the last version of the platform
was released. Well, as you would bet - so much work has gone into the platform
and we feel its best to have everyone enjoy the additional features and fixes.
To that effect, we have a code-freeze on to give room for thorough testing
before release of version 2.7 of the platform. The release is scheduled for
April 30th, until then we have tagged a 2.7b branch, which is the &quot;beta
release&quot; and no commits are being added here as testing is in progress.
The Develop branch remains open for codes commits so go ahead and send in the
pull requests for any bug or feature you work on.</span></p>

<p class=""><span style="font-size:11pt;font-family:&#39;Times New Roman&#39;;color:rgb(14,0,45)">We shall keep you posted as we get close to the release date.</span></p>
