HI folks, Happy Week.<br><br>The full <a href=" http://blog.ushahidi.com/2013/04/17/weekly-uchaguzi-hangout-code-of-conduct-testing-2-7/">weekly</a> blog post including Help wanted and Deployments of the Week <br><br><b>Highlights:</b><br>

<br>We&#39;ve got a Draft <b>Code of Conduct</b> for the Ushahidi community. Can you take a look? Did we miss anything? Please add your comments to this list or to the wiki. We&#39;d really like to make this as flexible and relevant as possible: <a href="https://wiki.ushahidi.com/display/WIKI/Code+of+Conduct">the Code Draft</a><br>

<br><br><b>Upcoming online events:</b><br>We had a great second environmental hangout today featuring the work of OpenIR. Great to see how imagery can change action or map views.  What other hangouts or events would you like us to have?<br>

<br>The next community focused Google Hangout will be Monday, April 22nd. Daudi Were and the Uchaguzi team will share their input about the Kenyan Elections. It was a large deployment with thousands of messages. Maybe our lessons will help your work.<br>
