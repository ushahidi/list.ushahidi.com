Actually, what eMoksha is using isn&#39;t what&#39;s in core. MHI isn&#39;t documented yet since it&#39;s it&#39;s functionality is still somewhat in flux. If you want to give it a go on your own, you can. A lot of the views in there have hardcoded strings for Crowdmap but that should be changing in early 2011.<br>

<br>The basics to get MHI working are this...<br>1. Apache needs to be set up so that it wildcards subdomains and drops them in your directory with the site.<br><br>2. The MySQL user you are using needs to have the ability to create new databases since each deployment actually has it&#39;s own db.<br>

<br>3. MHI needs to be set to true in config.php :P<br><br>Those are the most basic prerequisites but I cannot guarantee it will work out of the box.<br><br>Brian<br><br><br><div class="gmail_quote">On Wed, Dec 29, 2010 at 1:26 AM, Kaushal Jhalla <span dir="ltr">&lt;<a href="mailto:ksjhalla@...">ksjhalla@...</a>&gt;</span> wrote:<br>

hello again<br>
<br>
curious, has anyone used the multiple hosted instances functionality on their own?<br>
<br>
I am just about to do some experimenting with it to answer a question for a gent at <a href="http://mioterritorio.com" target="_blank">mioterritorio.com</a>, and realized that I had not seen any installs except the <a href="http://crowdmap.com" target="_blank">crowdmap.com</a>.<br>



<br>
cheers<br>
