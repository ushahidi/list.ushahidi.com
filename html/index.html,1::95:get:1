<br><div class="gmail_quote"><div class="gmail_quote"><ul>Peace First has launched new national campaign to celebrate young people<br>
leading change to create peaceful communities. Five amazing young people<br>
between the ages of 8 and 22 will each receive a $50,000 two-year<br>
Fellowship to recognize their peacemaking work and invest in their<br>
leadership. Given all of the difficult and violent news we have witnessed<br>
of late as a nation, the Prize offers a more promising way to view young<br>
people and celebrate their contributions to society.<br>
 <br>
Winners will be chosen on these key criteria: compassion, courage, and the<br>
ability to engage others in creating positive change. Applications are now<br>
open and will be accepted through April 12. Please share this with others<br>
so we can tell uplifting and inspiring stories about young people. Go to<br>
<a href="http://www.peacefirst.org/prize" target="_blank">www.peacefirst.org/prize</a> to share the Prize with a young person you know or<br>
nominate them today!<span><font color="#888888"><br></font></span></ul></div></div><br>--<br>
