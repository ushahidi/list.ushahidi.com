<div dir="ltr">Sorry on the slow response. There shouldn&#39;t be any issue remaining on 2.7/2.x and using the existing application. We&#39;ll be working pretty hard not to pull the rug from under anyone when we start releasing the 3.x code.</div>

Hi Bill,<div>3.0 is a full rewrite of the codebase and API. So there will definitely be some lag before the mobile app catches up.</div><div>However we are building a mobile friendly web UI with 3.0 which might help in the mean time, depending on your mobile needs.</div>

it would be jarring to suddenly lose access with an update to 3.0.<br>

&gt; Hey, I am a touch confused on this based on the various user groups.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; While I agree that too many categories might be a poor path for deployments,<br>
&gt; I think we need to be flexible.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Categories are currently used for Top keywords, sub-categories and sometimes<br>
&gt; location, actions and, even, task groups. See the analysis of Corruption<br>
&gt; mappers. I like to say there is a difference between - what the deployer<br>
&gt; wants to collect/analysis and what the reporter has 1. time for 2.<br>
&gt; comprehension of what is being requested = eg. what is the difference<br>
&gt; between &quot;damage&quot; and &quot;instrastructure damage&quot;. Part of this is up to the<br>
&gt; deployers to teach and define well, but the ways that categories get<br>
&gt; selected matter.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; I think that some groups use &quot;location&quot; within categories to give better<br>
&gt; drill into the data. IF polygons, layers and even search worked at a decent,<br>
&gt; usable level, then this would maybe not be a kluge.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Sometimes deployers use categories for workflow for large teams. How will<br>
&gt; this be addressed?<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; I am not sure that &#39;tags&#39; will assist the researchers and reporters. Can you<br>
&gt; please go into how this will work inside the deployment and for exports?<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; +1 on Rob&#39;s questions which are still outstanding.<br>

&gt;&gt; As long as filtering is available for both (and from more than just one<br>
&gt;&gt; section of the public site), this seems to make sense so far.  Will the<br>
&gt;&gt; report status options be separated from the categories?  Having the status<br>
&gt;&gt; and context categories in the same place for Uchaguzi definitely felt like<br>
&gt;&gt; the biggest-but-functional hack of that deployment.<br>
&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; Thanks for sharing this with the larger team,<br>

&gt;&gt;&gt; Yes, this makes great sense and seem very streamlined and provides good<br>

&gt;&gt;&gt; Hi All,<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; I&#39;m in London with the 3.0 team this week trying to figure on the many<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; many details involved.<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; We&#39;ve just finished up a discussion about how categories will work so I&#39;m<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; writing it up while its fresh. Categories have been a major tool in 2.x but<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; I&#39;ve always felt they&#39;re kind of abused and that often there&#39;s a better way<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; to represent the data we capture via categories.<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; Key discussion points: Do categories need a multi level hierarchy? Do<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; categories need to be multiple select?<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; Categories will be single select. But we temper this by adding multiple<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; category types, and possibly giving report types a colour and icon.<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; Categories won&#39;t have a hierarchy, since this info is often better<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; handled by a custom field instead.<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; Here&#39;s an example to explain.. lets take a subset of the Uchaguzi<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; categories<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; Polling Station Administration<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; Ballot Box Irregularities<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; Polling Station Closed Before Voting Concluded<br>

&gt;&gt;&gt; Missing/Inadequate Voting Materials<br>
