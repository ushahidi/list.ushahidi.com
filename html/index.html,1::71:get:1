<b>Description<br><br>
</b>‘Share’ term has turned into a key issue of many successful
initiatives in recent times. Following the advent of Web 2.0, such
positive experiences based on mass collaboration generated “Wikinomics”
have become “Socialnomics”, where “Citizens are voluntary
sensors”.<br><br>
During the past decades, the main issue in GIS implementation has been
the availability of sound spatial information. Nowadays, the wide
diffusion of electronic devices providing geo-referenced information have
resulted in the production of extensive spatial information datasets.
This trend has led to “GIS wikification”, where mass collaboration plays
a key role in main components of spatial information frameworks
(hardware, software, data, and people). Some authors (Goodchild, 2007)
talk about “Volunteered Geographic Information” (VGI), as the harnessing
of tools to create, assemble, and disseminate geographic information
provided by individuals voluntarily creating their own contents by
marking the locations of occurred events or by labeling certain existing
features. not already been shown on map.<br><br>
The term “neogeography” is often adopted to describe people activities
when using and creating their own maps, geo-tagging pictures, movies,
websites, etc. It could be defined as a new bottom – up approach to
geography prompted by users, therefore introducing changes in the roles
of ‘traditional’ geographers and ‘consumers’ of geographical contents
themselves. The volunteered approach has been also adopted by important
organizations.<br><br>
Whilst technologies (e.g. GPS, remote sensing, etc.) can be useful in
producing new spatial data, volunteered activities are the only way to
update and describe such data. If, on one hand, spatial data have been
produced in various ways, on the other hand remote sensing, sensor
networks and other electronic devices generate a great flow of relevant
spatial information concerning several aspects of human activities or of
environmental phenomena monitoring. Further, during natural calamitous
events (e.g. earthquakes, hurricanes, etc.), a crucial contribution to
the response planning and emergency management derive really from data
created by amateur citizens, who report the status of disaster-hit areas
by using mobile devices or ad hoc Web-GIS services.<br><br>
This “Information-Explosion Era” is characterised by a large amount of
information produced both by human activities and by automated systems;
the capturing and the manipulation of this information leads to” urban
computing” and represents a sort of bridge between computers and the real
world, accounting for the social dimension of human environments. This
technological evolution produced a new Paradigm of Urban Development,
called “u-City”, mainly rooted in Korea. Its transposition outside Asian
contexts has led to the smart cities concept.<br><br>
Such phenomena offer new challenges to scholars (geographers, engineers,
planners, economists, sociologists, etc.) as well as to spatial planners
in addressing spatial issues and a wealth of brand-new, updated data,
generally created by people who are interested in geographically related
phenomena. As attention is to-date dedicated to visualization and content
creation, little has still been done from the spatial analytical point of
view and in involving users – as citizens – in participatory geographical
activities.<br><br>
