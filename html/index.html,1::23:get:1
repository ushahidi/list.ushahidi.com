HI Folks, There were a few items in this week&#39;s report which may be of interest;<br><br>We receive many requests from students and researchers asking for tips on how to help out.  <br><ul><li>Do you have any topic ideas to add to this <a href="https://wiki.ushahidi.com/display/WIKI/Research+Community">research wiki page</a>? I can then refer the students there.</li>

<li>Would you like to help mentor these students?</li></ul>Tech President has a new &quot;Politics and the Internet&quot; timeline project. They are looking for examples that demonstrate this globally. Perhaps you can add some examples from Ushahidi deployments or other examples that you know about? <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/viewform?formkey=dFNQT3NYNG5zOGFTRm1sQXpxY0NQZEE6MQ#gid=0">Here&#39;s the form</a><br>

I&#39;m writing up some documentation. We&#39;ll post about this on the blog early next week. If you&#39;d like to take a test run, let me know and I will get you started. <br>
