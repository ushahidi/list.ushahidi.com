Ushahidi Community,<div>For my thesis I am trying to compare authoritative and VGI data sources for the Haiti earthquake of 2010. It is important for my research to set the datum for the latitude and longitude in the csv correctly, but I can&#39;t find which datum was used for this deployment. I&#39;ve searched the wiki and forums for &quot;datum&quot;, &quot;wgs84&quot;, and &quot;nad83&quot; but didn&#39;t get any hits.</div>
<div><br></div><div>Thank you for any help you can provide.</div><div><br></div><div>Michael Camponovo</div><div>Graduate Research Community</div><div>Department of Geography</div><div>University of New Mexico</div>
