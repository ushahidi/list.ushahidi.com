Dear Community members, perhaps you might be able to assist with the research request below? I would be happy to support someone who wants to take the lead in assisting this on behalf of Ushahidi.   <br><br>Maria, so nice to see your name pop up in my inbox. What an excellent project!  Ankit has been collecting relevant research on our community site: <a href="http://community.ushahidi.com/research/relevant-literature/">http://community.ushahidi.com/research/relevant-literature/</a><br>

<br>As well, we frequently post on our blog about these types of communities that intersect with Ushahidi. Perhaps someone could do a review of the posts?<br><br>Thanks, <br><br>heather <br><br> <br><br><div class="gmail_quote">

Dear Heather,<br><br>I hope everything is well with you! <br><br>I am writing to you here as a researcher at <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/" target="_blank">the engine room</a> working on the <a href="https://www.theengineroom.org/projects/digital-support-directory/" target="_blank">The Social Tech Census project</a>. I know that the team have contacted you before, but we are currently doing a last research sweep to make sure that our database is exhaustive.<br>


<br>We are now making deep dives into specific areas where we lack information - and I am hoping that you can help us with your notable knowledge from your work with open source communities. <br><br>As you may know, we are looking for resources characterized as: organizations/groups/communities (online/offline) that support (directly or asynchronously) to advocacy projects or organizations in using technology.<br>


<br>Any leads you can give us would be really helpful - also, please feel free to pass on my email to people that may have ideas for potential resources.<br><br>I look forward to hearing from you, Heather - take care!<br>


<br>My best,<br>Maria<br><br>--<br>MARIA GRABOWSKI <br>Researcher | the engine room<br>Skype | mariagrabowski<br>
