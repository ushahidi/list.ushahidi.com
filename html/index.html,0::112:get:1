This is an issue I&#39;ve been trying to fix for some time too, and is 
especially noticeable on deployments with +10K reports or on deployments with a few thousand points but on shared hosting. The way the 
clustering algorithm works is that it cycles through all the available 
clusters or points each time to determine what to group together. As you
 zoom in, the number of clusters increases even if they&#39;re well outside 
the viewport, and the more reports there are in the system, you&#39;ll 
notice the system start to take major hits as it performs the clustering
 calculation on higher zoom levels. You can see this with my own 
deployment at <a href="http://crime.mapatl.com">http://crime.mapatl.com</a> which has +30K points.<br><br>Here are some ways of fixing this issue:<br><ul><li>Caching
 - Turn on caching in the admin (+v2.0). By default the system uses 
filecaching, so each zoom level for each category will create an 
individual json file. This means your system won&#39;t have to perform the 
clustering calculation each time. If you can use Xcache or APC caching 
over File caching, you&#39;ll notice better performance. Increase the cache 
expiration to a day if possible or &#39;forever&#39; in cases where the data 
doesn&#39;t really change. This way the calculation will only be done once.</li><li>Restrict
 the calculation only to the viewport - this is written into the code 
but I disabled it because the calculation has to be repeated each time 
you pan (not just zoom) and can become quite cumbersome to the user - 
combined with the next point (cpu) it can be quite smooth.<br></li><li>More
 CPU!! This is the easy and expensive way out. If you have a 100K 
reports, you can always throw more firepower at it and perform the 
clustering in record time.<br></li><li>I&#39;d been working on a python 
script which perhaps can perform the calculations faster than PHP. In my
 initial tests though, the performance wasn&#39;t all that much different - 
I&#39;ll put it up somewhere and let some python gurus figure it out. PHP 
functions are both its strength and weakness - in a looped calculation 
like this one, each function is called tens of thousands of times and 
that&#39;s what makes the cpu beg for mercy. Bottomline, the more points you add to the 
system, the greater the need for a lower level programming language - time for some HipHop PHP?<br></li></ul><br><br clear="all">David Kobia<br><a href="http://www.ushahidi.com">www.ushahidi.com</a><br>Crowdsourcing Crisis Information<br>

<div style="word-wrap: break-word;">If anyone is online...<div><br></div><div>John McLear (@johnmclear)  is having an issue where he&#39;s got a large data set and the closer he zooms in the longer and longer the points on the map take to show up, even if there aren&#39;t that many on that particular map view.  Anyone have an idea what this could be and how to fix it?</div>
