Hi Paul, thanks for the input. I would be happy to take any input on what you think we need to do at Ushahidi to respect privacy and security (software or training wise)<br><br>Today I leave for InfoActivism Camp to learn from some other field communities. <br>

&gt; I&#39;ve been reading up on Privacy by Design. As we build 3.0, thinking<br>

<br>
</div>I&#39;m new to Ushahidi but I&#39;ve been working on privacy protection for a<br>
long time. I hope I&#39;m not out of line offering a suggestion here. I was<br>
the VP of privacy rights association here in Canada for several years.<br>
<br>
Privacy by Design is more gimmick than substance. It seems to be most<br>
useful as a PR tool for organizations looking to convince their<br>
customers that they care about privacy, when they actually don&#39;t. I&#39;ve<br>
had more than one argument with the Ontario Privacy Commissioner about<br>
this, to no avail.<br>
<br>
I wouldn&#39;t spend too much time on Privacy by Design as such. The one<br>
solid idea in the mix is that privacy should be a design consideration<br>
of the system from the start. Much like software security should be a<br>
design consideration from the start as well. I think that&#39;s worth<br>
focusing on and the rest of it is, unfortunately, fluff.<br>
<br>
Regards,<br>
Paul<br>
