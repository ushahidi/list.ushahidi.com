Hi All,<div><br><div>The Ushahidi 2.6 release has been pushed back a bit from the usual monthly/semi-monthly schedule. The internal team here have been very busy with the Uchaguzi (Kenyan Election monitoring) deployment and simulation. But we&#39;re pushing ahead and expect to start code freeze/create the release branch for 2.6 on October 5th.</div>

<div>Testing for Ushahidi 2.6 begins on October 6th and continues to the 14th.</div><div><br></div><div>** Plugin/Theme developers **</div><div>We&#39;d love it if you could test and update your plugins during this time too.</div>

<div>Feel free to post any issues you hit to this mailing list and we&#39;ll try to help you debug.</div><div><br></div><div>A couple of changes you might find cause trouble:</div><div>- We&#39;re updating to Openlayers 2.12 : this removes a few things.</div>

<div>In particular Openlayers.Control.LoadingPanel and Openlayers.Control.MouseDefaults are no longer available</div><div>- application/i18n is now in a submodule, so make sure you pull that in</div><div>- The NONE category is removed. As of 2.5 reports::fetch_incidents() includes reports with no category or location assigned.</div>

<div>Custom queries on incidents might need to be updated for this too.</div><div><div><br></div>-- <br><div>Robbie Mackay</div><div><br><div>Software Developer, External Projects</div><div>Ushahidi Inc</div><div>m: +64 27 576 2243<br>
