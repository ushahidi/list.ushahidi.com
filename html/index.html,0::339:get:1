<br>hope that make more sense. big thanks for the feedback. any more is welcome too.<br>cheers,<br>paul<br><br><div class="gmail_quote">On Thu, Jan 24, 2013 at 1:45 AM, Chris Blow <span dir="ltr">&lt;<a href="mailto:cblow@..." target="_blank">cblow@...</a>&gt;</span> wrote:<br>

<br><blockquote type="cite">hi everyone,<br><br>i started an Ushahidi map last spring to support a range of work being done for the Great Lakes. it's called the <a href="http://www.greatlakescommonsmap.org/" target="_blank">Great Lakes Commons Map</a>.<br>
<br>i'm hosting an event in Toronto on Sunday, February 3rd to showcase the site, but to also some needed feedback and direction. the project is very interdisciplinary and merges knowledge/skills in community mapping, digital storytelling, and of course open source technologies.<br>

<br>right now i have a pretty 'thin' development team and i'm looking for some new interest from the Ushahidi community.<br><br>if this project interests you in anyway, please consider checking out the site, getting in touch, and even coming on the 3rd if you're in the area.<br>
