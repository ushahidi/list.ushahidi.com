First I wanted to thank all of you for the hard work that&#39;s been put<br>
in so far. It&#39;s been a busy last few months and Ushahidi&#39;s codebase<br>
has grown significantly. The rate at which new features have been<br>
added to the system also means that bugs are rampant, many weeds have<br>
sprouted in the system that need to be pruned - and generally the<br>
system needs a little sprucing up. So I wanted to suggest the<br>
following:<br>
<br>
* A feature freeze on our current release cycle (1.2 -<br>
<a href="http://dev.ushahidi.com/versions/show/7" target="_blank">http://dev.ushahidi.com/versions/show/7</a>), and quite possibly bumping<br>
the 1.2 and 1.5 releases with an aim to release a 2.0 that is<br>
&#39;stable&#39;.<br>
* A code-a-thon focused on completing the currently listed features,<br>
and cleaning up the codebase.<br>
<br>
Cleaning house would encompass the following:<br>
<br>
1. Code Cleanup<br>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>
Our Controllers are horribly bloated. In a rush to get some of the<br>
stuff done, many MVC principles have been overlooked (or ignored!).<br>
Business logic should be in the models, and Application logic should<br>
be in the controllers. A controller with a few hundred lines of code<br>
is simply inexcusable, and we&#39;re all to blame in one way or another.<br>
To understand this better, you can go to:<br>

<br>
There&#39;s also a lot of repetition, so I want to encourage code re-use<br>
via helpers/library classes<br>
<br>
Since we&#39;re using the Kohana framework - it was agreed from the very<br>
beginning to stick to the Kohana coding standards, which you can view<br>
at: <a href="http://dev.kohanaphp.com/wiki/kohana2/CodingStyle" target="_blank">http://dev.kohanaphp.com/wiki/kohana2/CodingStyle</a> - Clearly we<br>
have plenty of work to do here. Moving forward it is absolutely<br>
necessary that we stick to these standards.<br>
<br>
<br>
2. API<br>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>
Our API needs to be absolutely bullet proof in order to encourage 3rd<br>
Party applications that interact with Ushahidi. So far it works very<br>
well, but a few functions could be optimized.<br>
<br>
<br>
3. UI Cleanup<br>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>
Cleaning up our User Interface involves the following:<br>
* Making sure our HTML is XHTML Compliant<br>
* Working on the admin user interface that now has a myriad of options<br>
and settings, and starting to become a little confusing for the end<br>
users<br>
* Less PHP in the Views<br>
<br>
<br>
4. Database Schema Cleanup<br>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>
There are quite a few stale schema records that need to be removed.<br>
Add to that the sql schema itself is poorly documented. One of the<br>
best sql schema conventions I&#39;ve come across is at Sahana<br>
(<a href="http://www.sahana.lk/wiki/doku.php/dev:sqlpolicies" target="_blank">http://www.sahana.lk/wiki/doku.php/dev:sqlpolicies</a>).<br>
<br>
<br>
5. Documentation<br>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>
In case it wasn&#39;t stated before we&#39;re using phpDocumenter (phpDoc), so<br>
any DocBlocks should follow their convention. Much has been done<br>
already with the current code, but more can be done.  Self-documenting<br>
code will be so much cleaner and comprehensible if we can add phpDoc<br>
DocBlocks to every file, class, function, and where needed - constant<br>
or variable. More information at:<br>
<a href="http://manual.phpdoc.org/HTMLSmartyConverter/HandS/phpDocumentor/tutorial_tags.pkg.html" target="_blank">http://manual.phpdoc.org/HTMLSmartyConverter/HandS/phpDocumentor/tutorial_tags.pkg.html</a><br>
<br>
Please feel free to add your thoughts to this discussion too!<br>
<br>
Lastly, please don&#39;t forget the Tuesday Skype Chats at 1pm GMT. Link:<br>
<a href="http://skype.ushahidi.com" target="_blank">http://skype.ushahidi.com</a> - we can discuss these items in detail, and<br>
a strategy for getting them done.<br>
