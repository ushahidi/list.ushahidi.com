Hello all,<br><br>Is anybody aware of a group that is currently using ushahidi for environmental governance?<br>We&#39;re anticipating doing a project in Guinea (Conakry) that sets up a reporting system for natural resource management concerns (clear cutting, poaching, etc.), and wanted to find some partners who could share their experiences / lessons with us.<br>
<br>Thanks.<br>Damien Brockmann<br>Alliance Guinea<br><a href="http://www.allianceguinea.org">http://www.allianceguinea.org</a><br><br>
